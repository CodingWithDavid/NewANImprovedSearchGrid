# Add a new and improved search box to our simple data grid for Blazor

A while back we created a search box that allowed the user to enter in som search term nd we would search for it with in the data collection we had and display the results.  It worked, but I came across a new and improved search box that lts the user select the "field" and enter in a search term.  This project is the simple data grid with the new and improved search box.
